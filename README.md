A 4: JS + GIT & GIT Submission
The final CA item requires you to submit a HTML page incorporating JavaScript. The web page will have five links that the user can click on.

When the user clicks on one of these links, we need to make two changes to the page:

Change the src of an image to the appropriate image specified below
Change the inner HTML of a paragraph to the appropriate text specified below.
Link	Image	Text

You can use any of the above images as the default setting.

Note that this may prove difficult, so ask for help if you hit any difficulties in completing the task.

Your HTML filename should use the format: CA4_Firstname_Lastname.html       (example: CA4_Tim_Simon.html)



After you are done with your Javascript + GIT assessment, you need to commit all the changes in your GIT repo and take screenshots, and include the screenshots in your submission. The GIT repo screenshots submission is worth 10% of the total grade for CA 4. The GIT screenshot(s) submission should show that you have completed all CAs, committed the changes to the working version, and pushed them to the GIT repo(s). 

Please note that your submission for this CA should include 2 files (two .zip file submissions - one for HTML, CSS, JS files and one for GIT screenshots submission).
